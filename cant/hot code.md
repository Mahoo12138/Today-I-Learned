Hot code (or hot code path) are execution paths in your application / compiler in which most of the execution time is spent, and thus which are potentially executed very often. For example, a game application may contain ECS (Entity-Component-System) alongside a game loop: thus, that application's `update()` and `draw()` methods have the most amount of execution time. This term may come up when talking about data locality or performance optimization.

A “hot path” is a code path that is perf-critical, either because it’s something that is really perf-intensive, or because it’s latency-sensitive. An example of the former is a long `for` loop, or large nested iteration that does some core computation and takes a long time. An example of the latter is the measure/layout/draw logic for your UI, which must be as fast as possible to avoid dropping frames. In general, these are code paths you want that to take the least amount of time possible, for one reason or another.
